The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a widely used free software license that guarantees end users the freedom to run, study, share, and modify the software. The license was originally written by Richard Stallman for the GNU Project. The text of the GNU GPL version 3, which was released in 2007, is as follows:

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software and share your changes with others. By doing these things you can obtain credit for your work and use it to benefit your community.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that prohibit anyone from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on the same freedoms to the recipients that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Everyone is always permitted to run the program, but only you, as the author, can decide if you want to offer warranty protection or not. For example, you might choose to explain your warranty obligations in a separate agreement.

The GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software – to make sure that you have the assistance you need to bring your program to the public.
