GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n http://fsf.org/\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n Preamble\n\n The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\n software and other kinds of works.\n\n When we talk about free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\n you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\n for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can\n get it if you want it, that you can change the software and share\n your changes with others, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n These rights are protected for you by our General Public License.\n\n 0. All rights reserved.\n\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of\n this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\n source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\n conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\n copyright notice; keep intact all the notices that refer to this\n License and to the absence of any warranty; and that you distribute\n the source code either under this License or under a license that is\n compatible with this License.\n\n 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\n of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\n distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\n above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that\n in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or\n from the modified version of the Program, to be licensed as a whole\n at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when\n run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive\n use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement\n including an appropriate copyright notice as well as a notice that there\n is no warranty (or else saying that you provide a warranty) and that\n users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling\n them how to view a copy of this License.\n\n 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\n under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\n Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n a) Accompany it with the corresponding machine-readable source code,\n which must be distributed under the terms of this License, in one of\n the following ways:\n\n 1. The source code must be included in the same distribution as the\n object code or executable form.\n\n 2. You must distribute the source code as a separate file, in\n which case you must make it clear that it is not part of the\n object code or executable form.\n\n 3. You must provide proper access to the source code.\n\n 4. You must, when and where you distribute object code or executable\n form, also include the information you received as to where the source\n code can be found.\n\n b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years,\n to give anyone who possesses the object code or executable form a copy of\n the corresponding source code, for a charge no more than your cost of\n performing this distribution.\n\n c) If you have run the Program, and it interacts with users, and you\n have not provided your source code, you must take reasonable steps to\n provide users with access to the source code of the Program, so they\n can be able to modify it.\n\n d) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or\n from the modified version of the Program, to be licensed as a whole\n at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n 4. You may not impose any further restrictions on the rights granted\n under this License. You may not use the Program's name, the name of\n its authors, or any other names that indicate the source of the Program\n without the prior written permission of the copyright owner.\n\n 5. This License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and\n change all versions of a program and to make sure that you receive or\n can get the source code. Therefore, you are not allowed to impose\n any further restrictions on the rights granted under this License.\n\n 6. You are not allowed to distribute the Program without also\n distributing the source code of the Program or providing proper access to\n the source code.\n\n 7. You are not allowed to impose any further restrictions on the rights\n granted under this License.\n\n 8. This License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and\n change all versions of a program and to make sure that you receive or\n can get the source code.\n\n 9. This License is designed to ensure that everyone has the freedom to\n share and change all versions of a program and that everyone has access\n to the source code.\n\n 10. This License may not be dismissed or amended without the written\n agreement of the copyright holder.\n\n 11. If you have any questions about the terms of this License, you\n can contact the Free Software Foundation, 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor,\n Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA.\n\n 12. This License is fully compatible with software distributed under\n other open-source licenses.\n\n 13. This License comes into effect upon execution.\n\n 14. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable,\n the remainder of the License shall continue in full force and effect.\n\n 15. This License is designed to ensure your freedom to distribute copies\n of free software and to charge for this service if you wish,\n and that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,\n and that you can change the software and share your changes with\n others.\n\n 16. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties\n regarding the use of the Program.\n\n 17. The original text of this License and a copy of the current version\n may be obtained from the Free Software Foundation.\n\n 18.
